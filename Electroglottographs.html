                  <!-- Enterprises is pleased to announce the availability of a calibrator
                  for its line of electroglottographs. The LS-1 larynx simulator plugs
                  into the neck-lead jack of any Glottal Enterprises EG series electroglottograph,
                  in place of the electrode cable, and provides an electrical simulation
                  of the small variation of neck resistance being measured by an electroglottograph
                  during voice production. The LS-1 is useful for measuring and verifying
                  the performance of the unit, and providing objective inter-unit comparisons.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p class="style1">
                  The simulated variation of neck resistance produced by the LS-1 was
                  chosen to maximize its usefulness in estimating the high and low frequency
                  responses from the resulting EGG waveform and measuring the signal-to-noise
                  ratio of the EGG and other processing systems employed. The LS-1 works
                  with both single-channel and dual-channel electroglottographs and will
                  also check the functioning of the electrode placement / laryngeal height
                  display when used with a dual channel unit.
              </p><br />
              <p class="style1">
                  The LS-1 can also be used with the Glottal Enterprises C-1 phase compensator
                  to correct the waveform for the phase distortion introduced by high-pass
                  filtering, as when using the audio board of a PC for data acquisition.
              </p><br />
              <p align="left" class="style1"><strong>Technical Details</strong> </p>
              <p class="style1">
                  The LS-1 simulates a neck resistance of 150 Ohms between the electrodes
                  of each EGG channel &ndash; a typical value &ndash; that varies 0.1%
                  at a frequency of about 200 Hz, with a duty cycle of approximately 60%
                  (vocal folds apart during 60% of the glottal period). A resistance variation
                  of 0.1% represents a typical variation in neck resistance during voicing,
                  and is roughly an average between the values of 0.3 to 0.5% found with
                  subjects having a very strong EGG signal and the values of about five
                  times less than 0.1% found with subjects having a very weak EGG signal.
                  The duty cycle chosen is convenient for checking measures of vibratory
                  duty cycle made from the EGG waveform and for enabling the user to verify
                  the polarity of the waveform (whether an increase in vocal fold contact
                  area corresponds to an increase or decrease in EGG waveform).
              </p><br />
              <p class="style1">
                  The simulated vocal fold vibratory frequency of 200 Hz was chosen to
                  make system frequency response factors easily judged from the resulting
                  EGG waveform. The variation of neck resistance simulated by the LS-1
                  is essentially instantaneous between the simulated glottal open and closed
                  phases, so that the high frequency response can be judged from the rise
                  and fall times of the resulting trace, and the low-frequency amplitude
                  and phase response can be judged from the slope and shape of the trace
                  during the simulated glottal open and closed periods. (For a perfect
                  low frequency response, the slope during each period would be negligible.)
              </p>
              <p class="style1">
                  When used with the C-1 compensator, the simulator&rsquo;s EGG trace
                  can also be used to correct EGG recordings for a degradation in low frequency
                  response caused by software after recording, or by analog circuitry before
                  recording. The C-1 compensator is an analog device that can be used for
                  this purpose. It is easily inserted between the EGG and the recording
                  or display system, and reduces the phase distortion introduced by high
                  pass filtering by a factor of three or more.
              </p><br />
              <p class="style1">
                  The LS-1 operates on an internal 9-volt alkaline battery, which in normal
                  use should last a number of years, or close to the shelf life of the
                  battery. A battery is supplied with the unit. The C-1 requires no power.
              </p>
              <p class="style1">
                  Adapter cables that allow the LS-1 or C-1 to be used with older models
                  of Glottal Enterprises electroglottographs or most electroglottographs
                  sold by other manufacturers can be provided at additional cost. Please

The two-channel design of the EG2-PCX2 electroglottograph makes it possible to give feedback to the investigator in real-time via an LED array on the front of the EG2-PCX2. You will know when you are properly centered on the glottis regardless of the test subject’s anatomy.

                                                Using the EGG signal as input, the F0 OUTPUT generates a standard impulse for each glottal cycle, roughly synchronous with the glottal closure instant.  It can be useful for teaching purposes, if recorded with any audio recorder and replayed, since it has only pitch information. It can also be useful for speech resynthesis or as the input to a pitch display.  However, since there is no complex logic to eliminate the occasional pulse generated by vocal fold motions other than in voicing, a generalized F0 detection software program operating directly on the EGG signal may often yeild a more useful result.

However, these programs will not supply the low frequency phase compensation for waveform correction that is in the Glottal Enterprises Waveview program. Our EGG’s are now supplied with the program PhaseComp which allows the user to display the EGG signal along with a time Synchronized microphone signal. PhaseComp also corrects one or both signals for low frequency phase distortion and estimates the closed or open quotients. The program VoceVista Signals is also supplied, which allows real-time viewing of these signals.

                                                Our EGG units are checked to have a noise level at least a factor of 100 (40 dB) less than a signal equivalent to a neck resistance change of 0.1 %.  This level of resistance change is attained, or at least approached, in a typical adult male larynx and neck anatomy.  However, with a typically smaller female or child larynx, and even with an adult male subject, if the larynx is deep into the neck muscle, fatty tissue, etc., the noise can be up to a factor of 10 (20 dB) higher.  Therefore when recording from persons showing a weaker than average EGG signal, it is important to use electrode jelly, press the electrodes into the neck a little, and use the unit's electrode position meter to optimize the vertical position of the electrodes.  Also, the anterior margins of the electrodes should be closely spaced, no more than about a centimeter apart.
                                                As for low-frequency noise, the low-frequency limit in a PCX model could be optimally a little higher with the higher F0 of a female or child voice.  (The low-frequency limit on the EG-2 model is adjustable, but the PCX value is set to 20 Hz.)  An external high pass filter set at about 50 Hz can reduce the low frequency noise for a female or child voice without hurting the waveform significantly.

                                                Also, the sensitivity of an EGG can make it susceptible to ambient electromagnetic noise from other electronic devices in the vicinity. This may show up only with subjects yielding a weak EGG signal.   If you suspect that there is an external noise source, try recording in another location and/or moving the EGG unit further from the computer.

                                                An EGG signal generally has two components, one caused by changes in vocal fold contact and one caused by tissue vibration. The second is usually close to sinusoidal in shape, since the mass of the tissues damps out any fast movements.

                                                In analyzing the classic, strong, EGG signal, the second or vibrational component is relatively weak and generally ignored. However, if the contact signal is weak, as in breathy voice or falsetto, the vibration component of the EGG signal may dominate. With some practice, one may be able to visually discriminate between the two components. To help illustrate the existence of two components, I have colored the vibration component red in the attached figure. The EGG signal is from a trained singer vocalizing a diminuendo at a pitch of D4 (approximately 290 Hz). The vocal folds are obviously abducting during the period shown in the graph. In the bottom chart, the almost sinusoidal vibrational component is shown in red, with the positive-most peak of the quasi-sinusoidal shape sketched in by hand to complete the sinusoid. (It is assumed that during the open part of the glottal cycle there is a negligible contact component.)

                                                At the lower right a true sinusoid of the approximate period and amplitude of the vibrational component has been plotted for comparison

                Glottal Enterprises helps researchers with proven voice measurement systems. Our products, found in leading research centers worldwide, are based on over 30 years of professional experience and innovative research in voice measurement. 
                Glottal Enterprises was founded by Martin Rothenberg, PhD, to offer other researchers the unique speech and voice measurement methods developed at the Speech Research Laboratory of Syracuse University. Glottal Enterprises products are based on Dr. Rothenbergâ€™s original research in speech, voice and language. 

His patented designs have brought researchers a broad line of airflow and pressure measurement tools. The equipment is widely preferred by professionals in speech, voice, language and singing research.<br><br>

           Dr. Martin Rothenberg, President of Glottal Enterprises since 1981, is Professor Emeritus of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Syracuse University, and he directed the Speech Research Laboratory there from 1966 to 1992. This laboratory specialized in research on the human voice and in the development of non-invasive techniques for the measurement of vocal function during speech and singing.<br><br>
       
           From 1986 to 1991, the Speech Research Laboratory included an interdisciplinary research team studying the use of computer-based multimedia instruction in language learning. Syracuse Language Systems (SLS) was formed by members of that research team in 1991, and, with Dr. Rothenberg as President and CEO, produced a series of award-winning CD-ROM titles for language instruction. In 1998, SLS was sold to the Cendant Corporation, and Dr. Rothenberg redirected his energies to the development of techniques for the measurement of vocal function.<br><br>

           Dr. Rothenberg was a NDEA Title IV Fellow during his graduate studies at the University of Michigan, from 1960 to 1964. He was a Fulbright Senior Research Fellow in Sweden in 1980, studying the voice and speech patterns of children. In 1993 he received the Fifth Annual Quintana Voice Research Award of Achievement, awarded by The Voice Foundation.<br><br>

           Dr. Rothenberg is the author of numerous papers related to the use of the human voice in speech and singing, and he holds four patents for speech-related measurement devices and systems.<br><br>

                       <br />

                        <br />The NAS software can be used interchangeably with either a handle that uses the proprietary <b>Glottal Enterprises dual-chamber circumferentially vented (CV) mask</b>, or a Glottal Enterprises Separator Handle which uses a partition plate held against the upper lip. With all handle styles, all electronics required is contained in a rectangular box mounted on the handle, and connecting to a USB port on your computer.

                   <strong>Glottal Enterprises does not promote the use of its <a href="#" class="tip">Nasalance<span>Nasalance is a measure of the degree of velopharyngeal opening in voiced speech  formed by computing the ratio of the amplitude of acoustic energy at the nares, An, to the amplitudes of the total radiated acoustic energy, at the mouth and nose, Am +An.

The term nasalance usually refers to this ratio as a percentage: An/(Am+An)X100</span></a> does not directly reflect the subjective level of nasal resonance.  One reason is that <a href="#" class="tip">nasalance<span>Nasalance is a measure of the degree of velopharyngeal opening in voiced speech  formed by computing the ratio of the amplitude of acoustic energy at the nares, An, to the amplitudes of the total radiated acoustic energy, at the mouth and nose, Am +An.

                              <li>The greatly reduced speech distortion of the Glottal  Enterprises CV mask means that recorded speech can be heard clearly during testing and when replayed, and results in more meaningful  SPL measurements. <strong>To compare the sound quality with a Glottal Enterprises CV mask with that from a hard-walled respiratory mask such as that used in the Kay-Pentax system, <a href="soundsamples.htm">click here</a>. </strong></em></li>
                              
                              <li>The  wide bandwidth of the airflow recording system means that the airflow pulse pattern during the vocalization can be seen on the  display, and not  just the variation  in average airflow.&nbsp; Thus, irregular  vocal fold vibration and breathy voice (incomplete vocal fold closure) can be easily identified.</em> <span class="style8">Using the Waveview analysis  program, inverse filtering can be performed for an even better resolution  of the glottal airflow waveform.</span></li>
                              
                              <li>Aeroview uses a USB input on any Windows XP computer,  even a laptop.&nbsp; Requires no hardware installation in the computer. &nbsp;Easily moved between computers.</em></li>
                              
                              <li>The optional dual-chamber mask available for use  with the Aeroview system can be used to  stop nasal airflow leakage in a soft voice when measuring Phonation Threshold  Pressure, a common source of PTP error.</em></li>

                    To make the Aeroview program available to students as an instructional tool, as well as provide a thorough 
                    evaluation package for prospective purchasers, Martin Rothenberg has also developed the AeroviewStudent interactive 
                    instructional program that includes most of the capabilities of the full version, except for the capability to 
                    record new waveforms, plus a number of carefully selected prerecorded waveforms of simultaneous oral airflow and 
                    intraoral pressure. AeroviewStudent is available from Glottal Enterprises at low cost on a CD that also contains a 
                    detailed 10-page Exercise Manual  The steps in this interactive manual use the prerecorded waveforms to enable the 
                    user to learn the operation of the analysis functions of Aeroview and the interpretation of the results for normal 
                    and disordered voice qualities.

                        <strong>1. What are the relationships between the NAS system, the NEM system and the NVS system?</strong><br>
                        There are a number of ways that our systems for visualizing nasality can be purchased. The full Nasality Visualization System (NVS) 
                        includes the capability for measuring Nasal Emission (NEM-1, formerly NE-1) and the system for measuring nasalance (NAS-1 system). 
                        As part of the NVS system, the NAS-1 system has both the mask and partition options. (Nasal Emission measurement requires the mask.) 
                        There is a price advantage when purchasing the complete NVS system over purchasing the NAS-1 and NEM-1 separately.

                        <p>
                            <br>
                            <strong>2. How does the NEM system for recording nasal emission work? Is it accurate enough for research applications?</strong><br>
                            The NEM-1 system uses the standard Glottal Enterprises dual-chamber (OroNasal) mask to isolate nasal airflow. 
                            The flow rate is measured by a transducer mounted in the mask handle, as is the acoustic signal. The software records 
                            and displays both signals simultaneously and they are superimposed on the screen in a chart display. (See the dual-chamber 
                            mask and a typical screen at http://www.glottal.com/Products/NVS.htm#NE1.) Average values of NE and SPL can be obtained for 
                            a chosen speech segment. You definitely can do research measuring nasal emission with the NEM-1. It is also useful in speech training tasks.
                            <p>
                                <br>
                                <strong>3. Some clinicians believe that the measure “nasalance” refers only to the numbers resulting from a version of a 
                                nasometer marketed by KayPentax, or previously by Kay Elemetrics. Is that true?</strong><br>
                                No, this is not true. The term ‘nasalance’ was proposed by Fletcher and his associates in the early 1970s for the variable measured 
                                by his various TONAR systems. KayPentax later adopted it for their version of the TONAR system. It was not originally proposed by KayPentax. 
                                [Fletcher, S.G. and Frost, S.D., Quantitative and Graphic Analysis of Prosthetic Treatment for Nasalance in Speech, J. of Prosthetic 
                                Dentistry, Vol. 32, 284-91 (1974); Fletcher, S.G., Nasalance vs. Listener Judgments of Nasality, Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal, 
                                Vol. 13, 31-44 (1976)] The term ‘nasalance’ was put forth as a generic term for this type of measurement and is used that way in the 
                                literature. For example, Tim Bressman, in the article "Comparison of Nasalance Scores Obtained With the Nasometer, the NasalView and 
                                the OroNasal System" (Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal, Vol. 42, No. 4 (2005)) recognizes that there are at least three systems being 
                                marketed that measure nasalance. This assumption was accepted by the reviewers and the Journal editors, and has never been challenged 
                                in the literature. The term ‘nasalance’ is not a trademark, but a descriptor for a general type of measurement. As another example, 
                                Baken and Orlikoff, in their widely respected book Clinical Measurement of Speech and Voice, state that "The term nasalance has been 
                                coined to describe this measure". Thus nasalance describes a measure, not the output of a specific device, just as the word ‘weight’ 
                                describes a measure, not the reading of a particular scale.
                    <p>
                        <br>
                        <strong>4. Is it true that when a new version of a nasalance measurement system is put on the market, it is necessary to duplicate previous 
                        evaluation studies?</strong><br>
                        It is not necessary for a newcomer to a field to replicate previous testing. It is only necessary to determine that the new system 
                        is essentially equivalent to, or better than, the old one in performance.
                    <p>
                        <br>
                        <strong>
                            5. Are the placement and orientation of the microphones and partition important for proper nasalance
                            values to be obtained?
                        </strong><br>
                        Using a handle or headset with a partition resting on the upper lip, measurements of nasalance will vary somewhat with the 
                        angle at which the partition meets the face. This is true of all devices employing a partition held against the upper lip. 
                        However, when using the Glottal Enterprises OroNasal mask for nasal and oral sound separation, the orientation of the mask handle 
                        does not affect the readings, as long as the mask makes contact with the face. Thus, the convenience of the partition and the lack of 
                        speech muffling may make it preferable for speech training, classroom demonstration, studies of the singing voice and many clinical 
                        measurement applications. For the stability required for some research purposes, the mask may be preferred. The Glottal Enterprises 
                        nasalance measurement systems offer the user a choice.
<p>
    <br>
    <strong>6. Should nasal consonants (periods during which there is an oral closure and no velopharyngeal closure) 
    be included in measurements of average nasalance?</strong><br>
    Mixing of nasal consonants and vowels in a nasalance reading is theoretically incorrect. Nasalance is only properly defined during vowels and 
    vowel-like consonants, when the oral pathway is open. It has no accepted meaning during a nasal consonant when the oral pathway is closed. The Glottal 
    Enterprises software is the only system that allows you to exclude nasal consonants in an average reading by a mouse click. However some users may want 
    to include the “nasalance” values recorded during speech sounds produced as a nasal consonant in a reading of average nasalance, as, for example, in 
    extremely disordered speech or to compare the numbers obtained with values in the literature obtained using older systems that did not have the capability 
    to eliminate nasal consonants. With the NAS-1 system you have a choice.
                    <p><br>
                        <strong>7. Why does the Glottal Enterprises system for measuring nasalance have periods in the chart during which no nasalance is computed?  </strong><br>
                            Nasalance should theoretically only be computed during voiced sounds in which the oral passageway is open. During periods in 
                            which there is little or no voice energy, such as the closure of a stop consonant such as /p/ or /b/, or during a fricative 
                            consonant such as /s/, /z/, /f/, or /v/, the software in the NAS system uses an acoustic threshold criterion to determine that 
                            there is no voiced vowel and does not compute nasalance. During nasal consonants, nasalance is computed, but identified by a change 
                            in color (to blue in the present version) so that the user can include or exclude values from average nasalance computations. It is 
                            important to realize that all nasalance measuring systems must have an acoustic threshold below which no nasalance is computed. In one 
                            popular system however, this threshold is not evident, since there are no gaps in the display. This is apparently caused by using a very 
                            long smoothing time, so that a gap is replaced with a dip in the nasalance value. The result is that the user cannot verify that the 
                            threshold was indeed set correctly (if it isn't, there will be an error in average nasalance computations) and the structure of the 
                            phrase or sentence will not be readily discernible. In the Glottal Enterprises nasalance system, the smoothing time is kept short enough 
                            so that the consonants and pauses are clearly identifiable.
                    <p><br>
                        <strong>8. How does the Glottal Enterprises system for automatically marking nasal consonants work? Is it reliable for patients having a speech disorder? </strong><br>
                        The theoretical basis for marking the approximate duration of a nasal consonant depends only on the presence of an oral closure and 
                        thus is valid for both normal and disordered speech. No judgment is made concerning the phonological intention of the speaker. As long as 
                        the oral passageway is open, the nasalance cannot rise above about 70% (assuming no strong obstruction in the nasal passages). When a complete 
                        closure of the oral passageway is approached (as in a nasal consonant), the nasalance will quickly rise above 70%. The NAS software identifies 
                        nasalance values above approximately 75% as being associated with an oral closure and, therefore, a nasal consonant. (If both nasal and oral 
                        passageways are closed, as in the closure of a stop consonant, both the nasal and oral energies will be small – that is, below threshold – and 
                        no nasalance value is computed.)

                      <p><br>
                        <strong>9. Can systems for measuring nasalance be used for measuring nasal emission in pressure consonants?</strong><br>
                        No. If a manufacturer claims that its nasalance system does measure nasal emission, it is a misstatement
                    <p><br>
                        <strong>10. Can a system for measuring nasal emission in pressure consonants also measure nasal airflow in vowels?</strong><br>
                        Yes, though perhaps not as conveniently as with a system measuring naslance.

                                            Using a handle or headset with a partition resting on the upper lip, measurements of nasalance will vary somewhat with the
                                            angle at which the partition meets the face. This is true of all devices employing a partition held against the upper lip.
                                            However, when using the Glottal Enterprises OroNasal mask for nasal and oral sound separation, the orientation of the mask handle
                                            does not affect the readings, as long as the mask makes contact with the face. Thus, the convenience of the partition and the lack of
                                            speech muffling may make it preferable for speech training, classroom demonstration, studies of the singing voice and many clinical
                                            measurement applications. For the stability required for some research purposes, the mask may be preferred. The Glottal Enterprises

                                            Mixing of nasal consonants and vowels in a nasalance reading is theoretically incorrect. Nasalance is only properly defined during vowels and
                                            vowel-like consonants, when the oral pathway is open. It has no accepted meaning during a nasal consonant when the oral pathway is closed. The Glottal
                                            Enterprises software is the only system that allows you to exclude nasal consonants in an average reading by a mouse click. However some users may want
                                            to include the “nasalance” values recorded during speech sounds produced as a nasal consonant in a reading of average nasalance, as, for example, in
                                            extremely disordered speech or to compare the numbers obtained with values in the literature obtained using older systems that did not have the capability
                                            to eliminate nasal consonants. With the NAS-1 system you have a choice.    </td>

                                            Nasalance should theoretically only be computed during voiced sounds in which the oral passageway is open. During periods in
                                            which there is little or no voice energy, such as the closure of a stop consonant such as /p/ or /b/, or during a fricative
                                            consonant such as /s/, /z/, /f/, or /v/, the software in the NAS system uses an acoustic threshold criterion to determine that
                                            there is no voiced vowel and does not compute nasalance. During nasal consonants, nasalance is computed, but identified by a change
                                            in color (to blue in the present version) so that the user can include or exclude values from average nasalance computations. It is
                                            important to realize that all nasalance measuring systems must have an acoustic threshold below which no nasalance is computed. In one
                                            popular system however, this threshold is not evident, since there are no gaps in the display. This is apparently caused by using a very
                                            long smoothing time, so that a gap is replaced with a dip in the nasalance value. The result is that the user cannot verify that the
                                            threshold was indeed set correctly (if it isn't, there will be an error in average nasalance computations) and the structure of the
                                            phrase or sentence will not be readily discernible. In the Glottal Enterprises nasalance system, the smoothing time is kept short enough
                                            so that the consonants and pauses are clearly identifiable.

                                            The theoretical basis for marking the approximate duration of a nasal consonant depends only on the presence of an oral closure and
                                            thus is valid for both normal and disordered speech. No judgment is made concerning the phonological intention of the speaker. As long as
                                            the oral passageway is open, the nasalance cannot rise above about 70% (assuming no strong obstruction in the nasal passages). When a complete
                                            closure of the oral passageway is approached (as in a nasal consonant), the nasalance will quickly rise above 70%. The NAS software identifies
                                            nasalance values above approximately 75% as being associated with an oral closure and, therefore, a nasal consonant. (If both nasal and oral
                                            passageways are closed, as in the closure of a stop consonant, both the nasal and oral energies will be small – that is, below threshold – and
                                            no nasalance value is computed.)
